## 1. Description

Shecret is a CLI SSH/SFTP client


Once the connection is selected, the full SSH/SFTP command will be stored on your clipboard, then just paste it on the terminal! 

It also issues SSH commands to multiple servers at once (sort of what [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) does).

It also checks server status (ping), so you know whether the server is online.
